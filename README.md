This file contains the following functions:

### final_func_1

``` 
Contains entire pipeline, from data preprocessing to making final predictions.
Takes raw data as input.
Return predictions for your input. Here the input can be a single point or a set of points.
def final_fun_1(X):
.....
.....
..... # the best model found by experimentation is used to predict.
return predictions made on X ( Raw Data)
```


### final_func_2

``` 
Contains entire pipeline, from data preprocessing to making final predictions.
Takes raw data as input.
Return predictions for your input. Here the input can be a single point or a set of points.

def final_fun_2(X,Y):
.....
.....
..... # the best model found by experimentation is used to predict.
return final_metric computed on X ( Raw Data) and Y (target variable)
```
